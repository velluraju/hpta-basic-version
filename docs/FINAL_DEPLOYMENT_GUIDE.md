```cmd
docker_build.bat
```

#### Linux/Mac Users:
```bash
chmod +x docker_build.sh
./docker_build.sh
```

### **🌐 Access Your Platform**
- **Main Application**: http://localhost:5000
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:5000/api/health
- **Nginx Proxy**: http://localhost:80

## 🔑 **Essential Setup Steps**

### **1. Get Google Gemini API Key**
1. Visit: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Create a new API key
3. Copy the key for use in the application

### **2. First-Time Setup**
1. Deploy using Docker commands above
2. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser
3. Enter your Gemini API key in the interface
4. Test with: *"Scan example.com for vulnerabilities"*

---

## 🧪 **Verification Tests**

### **Test 1: Application Health**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..."}
```

### **Test 2: CLI Server Integration**
```bash
python test_cli_integration.py
# Expected: All 5 tests should pass
```

### **Test 3: Docker Container Status**
```bash
docker-compose ps
# Expected: All services running and healthy
```

### **Test 4: Web Interface**
1. Open http://localhost:5000
2. Interface should load with dark cybersecurity theme
3. Chat interface should be responsive
4. File upload area should be visible

## 📁 **Data Persistence**

### **Docker Volumes**
```
docker-data/
├── reports/          # Generated security reports
├── uploads/          # User uploaded files
├── temp_reports/     # Temporary analysis data
└── config/           # Custom configurations
```

### **Report Access**
- Reports are automatically saved to `docker-data/reports/`
- Download links provided in web interface
- Reports include executive summaries and technical details

---

## 🔒 **Security Configuration**

### **Application Security**
- Input validation and sanitization
- File upload restrictions (100MB max)
- API rate limiting (10 req/s)
- CSRF protection enabled
- Security headers configured

### **Container Security**
- Non-root user execution
- Minimal base image
- Resource limits applied
- Network isolation
- Regular security updates

---

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**Issue**: "Port 5000 already in use"
```bash
# Solution: Stop conflicting services or change port
docker-compose down
# Edit docker-compose.yml to use different port
```

**Issue**: "Gemini API key not working"
```bash
# Solution: Verify API key is valid and has quota
# Get new key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
```

**Issue**: "Docker build fails"
```bash
# Solution: Ensure Docker Desktop is running
# Check available disk space (need ~2GB)
# Restart Docker service if needed
```

**Issue**: "Analysis stuck or slow"
```bash
# Solution: Check internet connectivity
# Verify target system is accessible
# Check Docker container logs for errors
```
